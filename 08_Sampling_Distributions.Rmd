## The Chi-Squared Distribution

1. Suppose that $X_1, \dots , X_n$ form a random sample from the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Find the distribution of
$$\frac{n (\bar{X} -\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}$$

2. Suppose that $Z_1, \dots , Z_6$ form a random sample from the standard normal distribution. Let 
$Y = (Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3)^2 + (Z_4 + Z_5 + Z_6)^2.$ 
Find the value of $c$ such that $cY$ has a Chi-squared distribution.

## Joint Distribution of the Sample Mean and Sample Variance

Nothing here.

## t-distribution
1. Suppose that $X_1, \dots , X_n$ form a random sample from the normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and unknown standard deviation $\sigma^2$, and let $\hat\mu$ and $\hat\sigma^2$ denote the M.L.E.'s of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. For the sample size $n = 17$, find a value of $k$ such that
$$Pr(\hat\mu > \mu +k\hat \sigma ) =0.95$$.

2. Suppose that $Z_1, \dots , Z_5$ form a random sample from the standard normal distribution. Let 
$Y = \frac{Z_1 + Z_2}{  \sqrt{Z_3^2 + Z_4^2 + Z_5^2 }}.$ 
Find the value of $c$ such that $cY$ has a $t$ distribution.
