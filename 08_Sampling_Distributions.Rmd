Nothing on this section.

## The Chi-Squared Distribution

1. Suppose that $X_1, \dots , X_n$ form a random sample from the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Find the distribution of
$$\frac{n (\bar{X} -\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}$$

2. Suppose that $Z_1, \dots , Z_6$ form a random sample from the standard normal distribution. Let 
$Y = (Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3)^2 + (Z_4 + Z_5 + Z_6)^2.$ 
Find the value of $c$ such that $cY$ has a Chi-squared distribution.

## Joint Distribution of the Sample Mean and Sample Variance

Nothing here.

## t-distribution
1. Suppose that $X_1, \dots , X_n$ form a random sample from the normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and unknown variance $\sigma^2$, and let $\hat\mu$ and $\hat\sigma^2$ denote the M.L.E.'s of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. For the sample size $n = 17$, find a value of $k$ such that
$$Pr(\hat\mu > \mu +k\hat \sigma ) =0.95$$.

2. Suppose that $Z_1, \dots , Z_5$ form a random sample from the standard normal distribution. Let 
$Y = \frac{Z_1 + Z_2}{  \sqrt{Z_3^2 + Z_4^2 + Z_5^2 }}.$ 
Find the value of $c$ such that $cY$ has a $t$ distribution.


## Confidence Intervals

1. Suppose that a sample of $n$ observations where  $X_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and we are interested in creating a confidence interval for $\sigma^2$ using the MLE estimator $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2$
    a) What function of $\hat{\sigma}^2$ and $\sigma^2$ has a completely known distribution (though the distribution depends on the known value of $n$)? 
    b) Using quantiles from the known distribution which you can denote as $\chi^*_{q,df}$ , create a formula for a $95$% confidence interval for $\sigma^2$.
 
2. Suppose that a smaple $n$ observations where $X_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \textrm{Exponential}(\beta)$ and we wish to find a 90% Confidence interval for $\beta$. Recall that $\sum X_i$ was the sufficient statistic, so our confidence interval should be a function of $\sum X_i$ and $n$ should be appropriate.
    a) What is the distribution of $\sum{X_i}$ and $\beta \sum X_i$? _Hint: recall that the Exponential is a special case of the Gamma distribution and we had a number of rules that we derived using the MGF method regarding the sum of Gamma random variables and a Gamma random variable multiplied by a constant._
    b) Denote the $q$th quantile of an arbitrary Gamma distribution as $\gamma^*_{q,\alpha,\beta}$. Use $\beta \sum X_i$ as a pivotal quantity to create a 90% CI for $\beta$.
