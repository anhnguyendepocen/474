# Preface {-}
This is a location for distributing homework questions for STA 474, Mathematical Statistics.  I am teaching this course out of DeGroot and Schervish, but I want to be able to expand the homework questions.  The first four chapters are commonly covered in STA 473, but I included them here in part because I want the chapter numbering scheme to match up with the book's numbering and also to show how the IBL version of 473 goes.
